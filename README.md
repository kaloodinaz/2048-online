The [2048 game](https://kaloodinaz.github.io/2048-online/) is a highly addictive and engaging puzzle game that combines strategy, logic, and a touch of luck. Created in March 2022 by Kaloo Dinaz, this minimalist yet challenging game quickly became a global sensation due to its simple mechanics and deep gameplay. Despite being easy to learn, the game offers immense replay value as players strive to achieve higher scores and reach the elusive 2048 tile.

2048 is played on a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles. The objective is to slide these tiles across the grid to combine identical numbers and create a tile with the value of 2048. To play, tiles slide in one of four directions—up, down, left, or right—when moved, shifting as far as possible in the chosen direction. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with a value equal to their sum. After every move, a new tile, either a "2" or a "4," appears randomly in an empty spot on the grid. The game ends when no moves are possible, either because the grid is full or no adjacent tiles can merge.

The goal is to create a tile with the value of 2048 by combining numbers strategically. However, the game doesn’t stop there. Many players continue playing to achieve even higher numbers, pushing their limits and improving their strategies.

The appeal of 2048 lies in its simplicity and challenge. The clean design and intuitive controls make it accessible to players of all ages. The mental exercise of planning a strategy to manage the board and predict future moves is highly engaging. Each game offers a unique experience due to the random placement of new tiles, and the satisfaction of achieving high scores keeps players motivated.
